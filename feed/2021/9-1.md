### [[2108.12971] HELMHOLTZ: A Verifier for Tezos Smart Contracts Based on Refinement Types](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12971)


  A smart contract is a program executed on a blockchain, based on which many
cryptocurrencies are implemented, and is being used for automating
transactions. Due to the large amount of money that smart contracts deal with,
there is a surging demand for a method that can statically and formally verify
them.
This article describes our type-based static verification tool HELMHOLTZ for
Michelson, which is a statically typed stack-based language for writing smart
contracts that are executed on the blockchain platform Tezos. HELMHOLTZ is
designed on top of our extension of Michelson's type system with refinement
types. HELMHOLTZ takes a Michelson program annotated with a user-defined
specification written in the form of a refinement type as input; it then
typechecks the program against the specification based on the refinement type
system, discharging the generated verification conditions with the SMT solver
Z3. We briefly introduce our refinement type system for the core calculus
Mini-Michelson of Michelson, which incorporates the characteristic features
such as compound datatypes (e.g., lists and pairs), higher-order functions, and
invocation of another contract. \HELMHOLTZ{} successfully verifies several
practical Michelson programs, including one that transfers money to an account
and that checks a digital signature.
